# Graphics Fun

It is fun

## Building
It's Rust, so:

```
cargo run
```

This program will accept the following features:

- `gl_debug` - Compiles the executable with openGL debugging turned on. This
  will log each time a openGL call is made, displaying an error if there is
  one. It's better than nothing....
